#Emergency department (ED) physicians often are uncertain about where in the hospital to triage patients 
#with suspected Acute Cardiac Ischemia (which may turn into a heart attack). This affects the quality of decisions in two ways: 
#efficiency and safety.

#Many patients without major complications are triaged unnecessarily to intensive 
#or intermediate cardiac care units, which leads to a low efficiency of decisions.

#Many patients who later experience life-threatening complications 
#were improperly diagnosed in the ED and not triaged to cardiac care units, raising concerns about the safety of decisions.

#In response to these concerns, researchers have developed the clinical 
#decision rule depicted in the flow chart attached, taken from the study by Reilly et al. (2002)*. 
#The decision rule stratifies patients in the ED by risk level (high, moderate, low, or very low) 
#and assigns them to various care units in the hospital (Coronary Care, Inpatient Telemetry, and Observation units). 

#The study analyses patient outcomes before and after the implementation of the clinical decision rule, 
#and concludes that the decision rule improved the efficiency of decisions without compromising safety.
